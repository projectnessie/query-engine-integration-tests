# hashcode method on array does not hash array contents

#ArrayToString=ERROR
# Calling toString on an array does not provide useful information

#ArraysAsListPrimitiveArray=ERROR
# Arrays.asList does not autobox primitive arrays, as one might expect.

#AsyncCallableReturnsNull=ERROR
# AsyncCallable should not return a null Future, only a Future whose result is null.

#AsyncFunctionReturnsNull=ERROR
# AsyncFunction should not return a null Future, only a Future whose result is null.

#AutoValueBuilderDefaultsInConstructor=ERROR
# Defaults for AutoValue Builders should be set in the factory method returning Builder instances, not the constructor

#AutoValueConstructorOrderChecker=ERROR
# Arguments to AutoValue constructor are in the wrong order

#BadAnnotationImplementation=ERROR
# Classes that implement Annotation must override equals and hashCode. Consider using AutoAnnotation instead of implementing Annotation by hand.

#BadShiftAmount=ERROR
# Shift by an amount that is out of range

#BanJNDI=ERROR
# Using JNDI may deserialize user input via the `Serializable` API which is extremely dangerous

#BoxedPrimitiveEquality=ERROR
# Comparison using reference equality instead of value equality. Reference equality of boxed primitive types is usually not useful, as they are value objects, and it is bug-prone, as instances are cached for some values but not others.

#BundleDeserializationCast=ERROR
# Object serialized in Bundle may have been flattened to base type.

#ChainingConstructorIgnoresParameter=ERROR
# The called constructor accepts a parameter with the same name and type as one of its caller's parameters, but its caller doesn't pass that parameter to it. It's likely that it was intended to.

#CheckNotNullMultipleTimes=ERROR
# A variable was checkNotNulled multiple times. Did you mean to check something else?

#CheckReturnValue=ERROR
# Ignored return value of method that is annotated with @CheckReturnValue

#CollectionIncompatibleType=ERROR
# Incompatible type as argument to Object-accepting Java collections method

#CollectionToArraySafeParameter=ERROR
# The type of the array parameter of Collection.toArray needs to be compatible with the array type

#ComparableType=ERROR
# Implementing 'Comparable<T>' where T is not the same as the implementing class is incorrect, since it violates the symmetry contract of compareTo.

#ComparingThisWithNull=ERROR
# this == null is always false, this != null is always true

#ComparisonOutOfRange=ERROR
# Comparison to value that is out of range for the compared type

#CompatibleWithAnnotationMisuse=ERROR
# @CompatibleWith's value is not a type argument.

# Non-compile-time constant expression passed to parameter with @CompileTimeConstant type annotation.

#ComputeIfAbsentAmbiguousReference=ERROR
# computeIfAbsent passes the map key to the provided class's constructor

#ConditionalExpressionNumericPromotion=ERROR
# A conditional expression with numeric operands of differing types will perform binary numeric promotion of the operands; when these operands are of reference types, the expression's result may not be of the expected type.

#ConstantOverflow=ERROR
# Compile-time constant expression overflows

#DaggerProvidesNull=ERROR
# Dagger @Provides methods may not return null unless annotated with @Nullable

#DangerousLiteralNull=ERROR
# This method is null-hostile: passing a null literal to it is always wrong

# Duration APIs only work for DAYS or exact durations.

#DurationToLongTimeUnit=ERROR
# Unit mismatch when decomposing a Duration or Instant to call a <long, TimeUnit> API

#EmptyTopLevelDeclaration=ERROR
# Empty top-level type declarations should be omitted

#EqualsHashCode=ERROR
# Classes that override equals should also override hashCode.

#EqualsNaN=ERROR
# == NaN always returns false; use the isNaN methods instead

#EqualsNull=ERROR
# The contract of Object.equals() states that for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false. If x is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. Consider replacing equals() with the == operator.

#EqualsReference=ERROR
# == must be used in equals method to check equality to itself or an infinite loop will occur.

#EqualsWrongThing=ERROR
# Comparing different pairs of fields/getters in an equals implementation is probably a mistake.

#FloggerFormatString=ERROR
# Invalid printf-style format string

#FloggerLogString=ERROR
# Arguments to log(String) must be compile-time constants or parameters annotated with @CompileTimeConstant. If possible, use Flogger's formatting log methods instead.

#FloggerLogVarargs=ERROR
# logVarargs should be used to pass through format strings and arguments.

#FloggerSplitLogStatement=ERROR
# Splitting log statements and using Api instances directly breaks logging.

#FormatStringAnnotation=ERROR
# Invalid format string passed to formatting method.

#FromTemporalAccessor=ERROR
# Certain combinations of javaTimeType.from(TemporalAccessor) will always throw a DateTimeException or return the parameter directly.

#FunctionalInterfaceMethodChanged=ERROR
# Casting a lambda to this @FunctionalInterface can cause a behavior change from casting to a functional superinterface, which is surprising to users. Prefer decorator methods to this surprising behavior.

#FuturesGetCheckedIllegalExceptionType=ERROR
# Futures.getChecked requires a checked exception type with a standard constructor.

#FuzzyEqualsShouldNotBeUsedInEqualsMethod=ERROR
# DoubleMath.fuzzyEquals should never be used in an Object.equals() method

#GetClassOnAnnotation=ERROR
# Calling getClass() on an annotation may return a proxy class

#GetClassOnClass=ERROR

# Checks for unguarded accesses to fields and methods with @GuardedBy annotations

#GuiceAssistedInjectScoping=ERROR
# Scope annotation on implementation class of AssistedInject factory is not allowed

#GuiceAssistedParameters=ERROR
# A constructor cannot have two @Assisted parameters of the same type unless they are disambiguated with named @Assisted annotations.

#GuiceInjectOnFinalField=ERROR
# Although Guice allows injecting final fields, doing so is disallowed because the injected value may not be visible to other threads.

#HashtableContains=ERROR
# contains() is a legacy method that is equivalent to containsValue()

#IdentityBinaryExpression=ERROR
# A binary expression where both operands are the same is usually incorrect.

#IdentityHashMapBoxing=ERROR
# Using IdentityHashMap with a boxed type as the key is risky since boxing may produce distinct instances

#IgnoredPureGetter=ERROR
# Getters on AutoValues, AutoBuilders, and Protobuf Messages are side-effect free, so there is no point in calling them if the return value is ignored. While there are no side effects from the getter, the receiver may have side effects.

# This method always recurses, and will cause a StackOverflowError

#InjectMoreThanOneScopeAnnotationOnClass=ERROR
# A class can be annotated with at most one scope annotation.

# This checker errors on calls to java.time methods using values that are guaranteed to throw a DateTimeException.

#InvalidPatternSyntax=ERROR
# Invalid syntax used for a regular expression

#InvalidTimeZoneID=ERROR
# Invalid time zone identifier. TimeZone.getTimeZone(String) will silently return GMT instead of the time zone you intended.

# Invalid zone identifier. ZoneId.of(String) will throw exception at runtime.

#IsInstanceIncompatibleType=ERROR
# This use of isInstance will always evaluate to false.

#IsInstanceOfClass=ERROR
# The argument to Class#isInstance(Object) should not be a Class

#IsLoggableTagLength=ERROR
# Log tag too long, cannot exceed 23 characters.

#JUnit4ClassAnnotationNonStatic=ERROR
# This method should be static

#JUnit4SetUpNotRun=ERROR
# setUp() method will not be run; please add JUnit's @Before annotation

#JUnit4TearDownNotRun=ERROR
# tearDown() method will not be run; please add JUnit's @After annotation

#JUnit4TestNotRun=ERROR

# Abstract and default methods are not injectable with javax.inject.Inject

#JodaToSelf=ERROR
# Use of Joda-Time's DateTime.toDateTime(), Duration.toDuration(), Instant.toInstant(), Interval.toInterval(), and Period.toPeriod() are not allowed.

#LiteByteStringUtf8=ERROR
# This pattern will silently corrupt certain byte sequences from the serialized protocol message. Use ByteString or byte[] directly

#LocalDateTemporalAmount=ERROR
# LocalDate.plus() and minus() does not work with Durations. LocalDate represents civil time (years/months/days), so java.time.Period is the appropriate thing to add or subtract instead.

#LockOnBoxedPrimitive=ERROR
# It is dangerous to use a boxed primitive as a lock as it can unintentionally lead to sharing a lock with another piece of code.

#LoopConditionChecker=ERROR
# Loop condition is never modified in loop body.

#LossyPrimitiveCompare=ERROR
# Using an unnecessarily-wide comparison method can lead to lossy comparison

#MathRoundIntLong=ERROR

# Overriding method is missing a call to overridden super method

#MissingTestCall=ERROR
# A terminating method call is required for a test helper to have any effect.

#MisusedDayOfYear=ERROR
# Use of 'DD' (day of year) in a date pattern with 'MM' (month of year) is not likely to be intentional, as it would lead to dates like 'March 73rd'.

#MisusedWeekYear=ERROR
# Use of "YYYY" (week year) in a date pattern without "ww" (week in year). You probably meant to use "yyyy" (year) instead.

#MixedDescriptors=ERROR
# The field number passed into #getFieldByNumber belongs to a different proto to the Descriptor.

#MockitoUsage=ERROR
# Missing method call for verify(mock) here

#ModifyingCollectionWithItself=ERROR
# Using a collection function with itself as the argument.

#MoreThanOneInjectableConstructor=ERROR
# This class has more than one @Inject-annotated constructor. Please remove the @Inject annotation from all but one of them.

MustBeClosedChecker=ERROR
# This method returns a resource which must be managed carefully, not just left for garbage collection. If it is a constant that will persist for the lifetime of your program, move it to a private static final field. Otherwise, you should use it in a try-with-resources.

#NCopiesOfChar=ERROR
# The first argument to nCopies is the number of copies, and the second is the item to copy

#NoCanIgnoreReturnValueOnClasses=ERROR
# @CanIgnoreReturnValue should not be applied to classes as it almost always overmatches (as it
# applies to constructors and all methods), and the CIRVness isn't conferred to its subclasses.

#NonCanonicalStaticImport=ERROR
# Static import of type uses non-canonical name

#NonFinalCompileTimeConstant=ERROR
# @CompileTimeConstant parameters should be final or effectively final

#NonRuntimeAnnotation=ERROR
# Calling getAnnotation on an annotation that is not retained at runtime.

#NullArgumentForNonNullParameter=ERROR
# Null is not permitted for this parameter.

#NullTernary=ERROR
# This conditional expression may evaluate to null, which will result in an NPE when the result is unboxed.

#OptionalEquality=ERROR
# Comparison using reference equality instead of value equality

#OptionalMapUnusedValue=ERROR
# Optional.ifPresent is preferred over Optional.map when the return value is unused

#OptionalOfRedundantMethod=ERROR
# Optional.of() always returns a non-empty optional. Using ifPresent/isPresent/orElse/orElseGet/orElseThrow/isPresent/or/orNull method on it is unnecessary and most probably a bug.

#OverlappingQualifierAndScopeAnnotation=ERROR
# Annotations cannot be both Scope annotations and Qualifier annotations: this causes confusion when trying to use them.

#OverridesJavaxInjectableMethod=ERROR
# This method is not annotated with @Inject, but it overrides a method that is annotated with @javax.inject.Inject. The method will not be Injected.

#PackageInfo=ERROR
# Declaring types inside package-info.java files is very bad form

#ParametersButNotParameterized=ERROR
# This test has @Parameters but is using the default JUnit4 runner. The parameters will have no effect.

#PeriodTimeMath=ERROR
# When adding or subtracting from a Period, Duration is incompatible.

#PreconditionsInvalidPlaceholder=ERROR
# Preconditions only accepts the %s placeholder in error message strings

#PrivateSecurityContractProtoAccess=ERROR
# Access to a private protocol buffer field is forbidden. This protocol buffer carries a security contract, and can only be created using an approved library. Direct access to the fields is forbidden.

#ProtoBuilderReturnValueIgnored=ERROR
# Unnecessary call to proto's #build() method. If you don't consume the return value of #build(), the result is discarded and the only effect is to verify that all required fields are set, which can be expressed more directly with #isInitialized().

#ProtoFieldNullComparison=ERROR
# Protobuf fields cannot be null.

#ProtoStringFieldReferenceEquality=ERROR
# Comparing protobuf fields of type String using reference equality

#ProtoTruthMixedDescriptors=ERROR
# The arguments passed to `ignoringFields` are inconsistent with the proto which is the subject of the assertion.

#ProtocolBufferOrdinal=ERROR
# To get the tag number of a protocol buffer enum, use getNumber() instead.

#ProvidesMethodOutsideOfModule=ERROR
# @Provides methods need to be declared in a Module to have any effect.

#RandomCast=ERROR
# Casting a random number in the range [0.0, 1.0) to an integer or long always results in 0.

#RandomModInteger=ERROR
# Use Random.nextInt(int). Random.nextInt() % n can have negative results

#RectIntersectReturnValueIgnored=ERROR
# Return value of android.graphics.Rect.intersect() must be checked

#RequiredModifiers=ERROR
# This annotation is missing required modifiers as specified by its @RequiredModifiers annotation

# Check for non-allowlisted callers to RestrictedApiChecker.

#ReturnValueIgnored=ERROR
# Return value of this method must be used

#SelfAssignment=ERROR
# Variable assigned to itself

# An object is compared to itself

#SelfEquals=ERROR
# Testing an object for equality with itself will always be true.

#ShouldHaveEvenArgs=ERROR
# This method must be called with an even number of arguments.

#SizeGreaterThanOrEqualsZero=ERROR
# Comparison of a size >= 0 is always true, did you intend to check for non-emptiness?

#StreamToString=ERROR
# Calling toString on a Stream does not provide useful information

#StringBuilderInitWithChar=ERROR
# StringBuilder does not have a char constructor; this invokes the int constructor.

#SubstringOfZero=ERROR
# String.substring(0) returns the original String

#SuppressWarningsDeprecated=ERROR
# Suppressing "deprecated" is probably a typo for "deprecation"

#TemporalAccessorGetChronoField=ERROR
# TemporalAccessor.get() only works for certain values of ChronoField.

#TestParametersNotInitialized=ERROR
# This test has @TestParameter fields but is using the default JUnit4 runner. The parameters will not be initialised beyond their default value.

#TheoryButNoTheories=ERROR
# This test has members annotated with @Theory, @DataPoint, or @DataPoints but is using the default JUnit4 runner.

#ThrowIfUncheckedKnownChecked=ERROR
# throwIfUnchecked(knownCheckedException) is a no-op.

#ThrowNull=ERROR
# Throwing 'null' always results in a NullPointerException being thrown.

#TreeToString=ERROR
# Tree#toString shouldn't be used for Trees deriving from the code being compiled, as it discards whitespace and comments.

#TruthSelfEquals=ERROR
# isEqualTo should not be used to test an object for equality with itself; the assertion will never fail.

#TryFailThrowable=ERROR
# Catching Throwable/Error masks failures from fail() or assert*() in the try block

#TypeParameterQualifier=ERROR
# Type parameter used as type qualifier

#UnicodeDirectionalityCharacters=ERROR
# Unicode directionality modifiers can be used to conceal code in many editors.

UnicodeInCode=OFF
# Avoid using non-ASCII Unicode characters outside of comments and literals, as they can be confusing.

#UnnecessaryCheckNotNull=ERROR
# This null check is unnecessary; the expression can never be null

#UnnecessaryTypeArgument=ERROR
# Non-generic methods should not be invoked with type arguments

#UnsafeWildcard=ERROR
# Certain wildcard types can confuse the compiler.

#UnusedAnonymousClass=ERROR
# Instance created but never used

#UnusedCollectionModifiedInPlace=ERROR
# Collection is modified in place, but the result is not used

# This field is guaranteed not to be set given it's within a switch over a one_of.

#XorPower=ERROR
# The `^` operator is binary XOR, not a power operator.

#AlmostJavadoc=WARN
# This comment contains Javadoc or HTML tags, but isn't started with a double asterisk (/**); is it meant to be Javadoc?

#AlreadyChecked=WARN
# This condition has already been checked.

#AmbiguousMethodReference=WARN
# Method reference is ambiguous

AnnotateFormatMethod=ERROR
# This method passes a pair of parameters through to String.format, but the enclosing method wasn't annotated @FormatMethod. Doing so gives compile-time rather than run-time protection against malformed format strings.

#ArgumentSelectionDefectChecker=WARN
# Arguments are in the wrong order or could be commented for clarity.

ArrayAsKeyOfSetOrMap=ERROR
# Arrays do not override equals() or hashCode, so comparisons will be done on reference equality only. If neither deduplication nor lookup are needed, consider using a List instead. Otherwise, use IdentityHashMap/Set, a Map from a library that handles object arrays, or an Iterable/List of pairs.

AssertEqualsArgumentOrderChecker=ERROR
# Arguments are swapped in assertEquals-like call

AssertThrowsMultipleStatements=ERROR
# The lambda passed to assertThrows should contain exactly one statement

AssertionFailureIgnored=ERROR
# This assertion throws an AssertionError if it fails, which will be caught by an enclosing try block.

#AssistedInjectAndInjectOnSameConstructor=WARN
# @AssistedInject and @Inject cannot be used on the same constructor.

#AutoValueFinalMethods=WARN
# Make toString(), hashCode() and equals() final in AutoValue classes, so it is clear to readers that AutoValue is not overriding them

#AutoValueImmutableFields=WARN
# AutoValue recommends using immutable collections

#AutoValueSubclassLeaked=WARN
# Do not refer to the autogenerated AutoValue_ class outside the file containing the corresponding @AutoValue base class.

#BadComparable=WARN
# Possible sign flip from narrowing conversion

BadImport=ERROR
# Importing nested classes/static methods/static fields with commonly-used names can make code harder to read, because it may not be clear from the context exactly which type is being referred to. Qualifying the name with that of the containing class can make the code clearer.

BadInstanceof=ERROR
# instanceof used in a way that is equivalent to a null check.

BareDotMetacharacter=ERROR
# "." is rarely useful as a regex, as it matches any character. To match a literal '.' character, instead write "\.".

BigDecimalEquals=ERROR
# BigDecimal#equals has surprising behavior: it also compares scale.

BigDecimalLiteralDouble=ERROR
# new BigDecimal(double) loses precision in this case.

BoxedPrimitiveConstructor=ERROR
# valueOf or autoboxing provides better time and space performance

#BugPatternNaming=WARN
# Giving BugPatterns a name different to the enclosing class can be confusing

#BuilderReturnThis=WARN
# Builder instance method does not return 'this'

ByteBufferBackingArray=ERROR
# ByteBuffer.array() shouldn't be called unless ByteBuffer.arrayOffset() is used or if the ByteBuffer was initialized using ByteBuffer.wrap() or ByteBuffer.allocate().

#CacheLoaderNull=WARN
# The result of CacheLoader#load must be non-null.

CanIgnoreReturnValueSuggester=OFF
# Methods that always 'return this' should be annotated with @CanIgnoreReturnValue

# Mockito cannot mock final classes

#CanonicalDuration=WARN
# Duration can be expressed more clearly with different units

CatchAndPrintStackTrace=ERROR
# Logging or rethrowing exceptions should usually be preferred to catching and calling printStackTrace

#CatchFail=WARN
# Ignoring exceptions and calling fail() is unnecessary, and makes test output less useful

#ChainedAssertionLosesContext=WARN
# Inside a Subject, use check(…) instead of assert*() to preserve user-supplied messages and other settings.

#CharacterGetNumericValue=WARN
# getNumericValue has unexpected behaviour: it interprets A-Z as base-36 digits with values 10-35, but also supports non-arabic numerals and miscellaneous numeric unicode characters like ㊷; consider using Character.digit or UCharacter.getUnicodeNumericValue instead

#ClassCanBeStatic=WARN
# Inner class is non-static but does not reference enclosing class

ClassNewInstance=ERROR
# Class.newInstance() bypasses exception checking; prefer getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()

#CloseableProvides=WARN
# Providing Closeable resources makes their lifecycle unclear

#CollectionUndefinedEquality=WARN
# This type does not have well-defined equals behavior.

#CollectorShouldNotUseState=WARN
# Collector.of() should not use state

#ComparableAndComparator=WARN
# Class should not implement both `Comparable` and `Comparator`

#CompareToZero=WARN
# The result of #compareTo or #compare should only be compared to 0. It is an implementation detail whether a given type returns strictly the values {-1, 0, +1} or others.

#ComplexBooleanConstant=WARN
# Non-trivial compile time constant boolean expressions shouldn't be used.

#DateChecker=WARN
# Warns against suspect looking calls to java.util.Date APIs

DateFormatConstant=ERROR
# DateFormat is not thread-safe, and should not be used as a constant field.

DefaultCharset=ERROR
# Implicit use of the platform default charset, which can result in differing behaviour between JVM executions or incorrect behavior if the encoding of the data source doesn't match expectations.

#DefaultPackage=WARN
# Java classes shouldn't use default package

#DeprecatedVariable=WARN
# Applying the @Deprecated annotation to local variables or parameters has no effect

#DirectInvocationOnMock=WARN
# Methods should not be directly invoked on mocks. Should this be part of a verify(..) call?

DistinctVarargsChecker=ERROR
# Method expects distinct arguments at some/all positions

#DoNotCallSuggester=WARN
# Consider annotating methods that always throw with @DoNotCall. Read more at https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DoNotCall

#DoNotClaimAnnotations=WARN
# Don't 'claim' annotations in annotation processors; Processor#process should unconditionally return `false`

#DoNotMockAutoValue=WARN
# AutoValue classes represent pure data classes, so mocking them should not be necessary. Construct a real instance of the class instead.

DoubleCheckedLocking=ERROR
# Double-checked locking on non-volatile fields is unsafe

#EmptyBlockTag=WARN
# A block tag (@param, @return, @throws, @deprecated) has an empty description. Block tags without descriptions don't add much value for future readers of the code; consider removing the tag entirely or adding a description.

#EmptyCatch=WARN
# Caught exceptions should not be ignored

# @Multibinds is a more efficient and declarative mechanism for ensuring that a set multibinding is present in the graph.

EqualsGetClass=ERROR
# Prefer instanceof to getClass when implementing Object#equals.

EqualsIncompatibleType=ERROR
# An equality test between objects with incompatible types always returns false

EqualsUnsafeCast=ERROR
# The contract of #equals states that it should return false for incompatible types, while this implementation may throw ClassCastException.

EqualsUsingHashCode=ERROR
# Implementing #equals by just comparing hashCodes is fragile. Hashes collide frequently, and this will lead to false positives in #equals.

ErroneousThreadPoolConstructorChecker=ERROR
# Thread pool size will never go beyond corePoolSize if an unbounded queue is used

EscapedEntity=ERROR
# HTML entities in @code/@literal tags will appear literally in the rendered javadoc.

#ExtendingJUnitAssert=WARN
# When only using JUnit Assert's static methods, you should import statically instead of extending.

#ExtendsObject=WARN
# `T extends Object` is redundant (unless you are using the Checker Framework).

#FallThrough=WARN
# Switch case may fall through

#Finally=WARN
# If you return or throw from a finally, then values returned or thrown from the try-catch block will be ignored. Consider using try-with-resources instead.

FloatCast=ERROR
# Use parentheses to make the precedence explicit

FloatingPointAssertionWithinEpsilon=ERROR
# This fuzzy equality check is using a tolerance less than the gap to the next number. You may want a less restrictive tolerance, or to assert equality.

FloatingPointLiteralPrecision=ERROR
# Floating point literal loses precision

#FloggerArgumentToString=WARN
# Use Flogger's printf-style formatting instead of explicitly converting arguments to strings

#FloggerStringConcatenation=WARN
# Prefer string formatting using printf placeholders (e.g. %s) instead of string concatenation

#FragmentInjection=WARN
# Classes extending PreferenceActivity must implement isValidFragment such that it does not unconditionally return true to prevent vulnerability to fragment injection attacks.

#FragmentNotInstantiable=WARN
# Subclasses of Fragment must be instantiable via Class#newInstance(): the class must be public, static and have a public nullary constructor

FutureReturnValueIgnored=ERROR
# Return value of methods returning Future must be checked. Ignoring returned Futures suppresses exceptions thrown from the code that completes the Future.

GetClassOnEnum=ERROR
# Calling getClass() on an enum may return a subclass of the enum type

#HidingField=WARN
# Hiding fields of superclasses may cause confusion and errors

#IdentityHashMapUsage=WARN
# IdentityHashMap usage shouldn't be intermingled with Map

#ImmutableAnnotationChecker=WARN

#InjectScopeAnnotationOnInterfaceOrAbstractClass=WARN
# Scope annotation on an interface or abstract class is not allowed

#InjectedConstructorAnnotations=WARN
# Injected constructors cannot be optional nor have binding annotations

# This deprecated API looks inlineable. If you'd like the body of the API to be inlined to its callers, please annotate it with @InlineMe.

#InputStreamSlowMultibyteRead=WARN

#PreconditionsCheckNotNullRepeated=WARN
# Including the first argument of checkNotNull in the failure message is not useful, as it will always be `null`.

# Saving instances of Throwable in static fields is discouraged, prefer to create them on-demand when an exception is thrown

#StaticGuardedByInstance=WARN
# Writes to static fields should not be guarded by instance locks

# String.split(String) has surprising behavior

#SwigMemoryLeak=WARN
# SWIG generated code that can't call a C++ destructor will leak memory

SynchronizeOnNonFinalField=ERROR
# Synchronizing on non-final fields is not safe: if the field is ever updated, different threads may end up locking on different objects.

#ThreadJoinLoop=WARN
# Thread.join needs to be immediately surrounded by a loop until it succeeds. Consider using Uninterruptibles.joinUninterruptibly.

ThreadLocalUsage=ERROR
# ThreadLocals should be stored in static fields

#ThreadPriorityCheck=WARN
# Relying on the thread scheduler is discouraged.

#ThreeLetterTimeZoneID=WARN
# Three-letter time zone identifiers are deprecated, may be ambiguous, and might not do what you intend; the full IANA time zone ID should be used instead.

#TimeUnitConversionChecker=WARN
# This TimeUnit conversion looks buggy: converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (and passing a constant), converting to/from the same TimeUnit, or converting TimeUnits where the result is statically known to be 0 or 1 are all buggy patterns.

#ToStringReturnsNull=WARN
# An implementation of Object.toString() should never return null.

#TruthIncompatibleType=WARN
# Argument is not compatible with the subject's type.

#TypeEquals=WARN
# com.sun.tools.javac.code.Type doesn't override Object.equals and instances are not interned by javac, so testing types for equality should be done with Types#isSameType instead

#TypeNameShadowing=WARN
# Type parameter declaration shadows another named type

#TypeParameterShadowing=WARN
# Type parameter declaration overrides another type parameter already declared

#TypeParameterUnusedInFormals=WARN
# Declaring a type parameter that is only used in the return type is a misuse of generics: operations on the type parameter are unchecked, it hides unsafe casts at invocations of the method, and it interacts badly with method overload resolution.

URLEqualsHashCode=ERROR
# Avoid hash-based containers of java.net.URL–the containers rely on equals() and hashCode(), which cause java.net.URL to make blocking internet connections.

#UndefinedEquals=WARN
# This type is not guaranteed to implement a useful #equals method.

#UnescapedEntity=WARN
# Javadoc is interpreted as HTML, so HTML entities such as &, <, > must be escaped. If this finding seems wrong (e.g. is within a @code or @literal tag), check whether the tag could be malformed and not recognised by the compiler.

#UnicodeEscape=WARN
# Using unicode escape sequences for printable ASCII characters is obfuscated, and potentially dangerous.

#UnnecessaryAssignment=WARN
# Fields annotated with @Inject/@Mock should not be manually assigned to, as they should be initialized by a framework. Remove the assignment if a framework is being used, or the annotation if one isn't.

UnnecessaryLambda=ERROR
# Returning a lambda from a helper method or saving it in a constant is unnecessary; prefer to implement the functional interface method directly and use a method reference instead.

#UnnecessaryLongToIntConversion=WARN
# Converting a long or Long to an int to pass as a long parameter is usually not necessary. If this conversion is intentional, consider `Longs.constrainToRange()` instead.

#UnnecessaryMethodInvocationMatcher=WARN
# It is not necessary to wrap a MethodMatcher with methodInvocation().

#UnnecessaryMethodReference=WARN
# This method reference is unnecessary, and can be replaced with the variable itself.

#UnnecessaryParentheses=WARN
# These grouping parentheses are unnecessary; it is unlikely the code will be misinterpreted without them

# This Javadoc tag wasn't recognised by the parser. Is it malformed somehow, perhaps with mismatched braces?

#UnsafeFinalization=WARN
# Finalizer may run before native code finishes execution

#UnsafeReflectiveConstructionCast=WARN
# Prefer `asSubclass` instead of casting the result of `newInstance`, to detect classes of incorrect type before invoking their constructors.This way, if the class is of the incorrect type,it will throw an exception before invoking its constructor.

# Unsynchronized method overrides a synchronized method.

UnusedMethod=ERROR
# Unused.

#UnusedNestedClass=WARN
# This nested class is unused, and can be removed.

#UnusedTypeParameter=WARN
# This type parameter is unused and can be removed.

#UnusedVariable=WARN
# Unused.

#UseBinds=WARN
# @Binds is a more efficient and declarative mechanism for delegating a binding.

UseCorrectAssertInTests=ERROR
# Java assert is used in test. For testing purposes Assert.* matchers should be used.

#VariableNameSameAsType=WARN
# variableName and type with the same name would refer to the static field instead of the class

#WaitNotInLoop=WARN
# Because of spurious wakeups, Object.wait() and Condition.await() must always be called in a loop

#WakelockReleasedDangerously=WARN
# A wakelock acquired with a timeout may be released by the system before calling `release`, even after checking `isHeld()`. If so, it will throw a RuntimeException. Please wrap in a try/catch block.

#WithSignatureDiscouraged=WARN
# withSignature is discouraged. Prefer .named and/or .withParameters where possible.
